# ðŸ§  Graph Neural Network (GraphSAGE) Based Intrusion Detection System

### ðŸ”’ Project Overview
This project presents an **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** built using **Graph Neural Networks (GNN)** â€” specifically the **GraphSAGE** architecture â€” to identify malicious patterns in network traffic data.  
The model is trained on the **UNSW-NB15 dataset**, one of the most comprehensive modern intrusion datasets, and classifies each network flow as either **Normal** or **Attack**.

Unlike traditional deep learning models that process each record independently, this system represents traffic as **graphs**, where:
- **Nodes** represent network flows (connections)
- **Edges** represent similarity between flows (using K-Nearest Neighbors)

By capturing these relational dependencies, the GraphSAGE model learns how network behaviors interact, leading to improved accuracy and robustness against complex and evolving attacks.
