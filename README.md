# 🧠 Graph Neural Network (GraphSAGE) Based Intrusion Detection System

### 🔒 Project Overview
This project implements an **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** using **Graph Neural Networks (GNN)**, specifically the **GraphSAGE** architecture, to identify malicious activity in network traffic.  
The system is trained on the **UNSW-NB15 dataset**, a comprehensive cybersecurity dataset that represents modern network behavior.  
Each network flow is modeled as a **node**, and **edges** are formed using **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** to represent similarities between flows.  

By leveraging the relational dependencies between flows, the GraphSAGE model can detect subtle anomalies and coordinated attacks that traditional machine learning models may overlook.

### 🔍 Observations

* GraphSAGE learns relational structures that enhance intrusion detection accuracy.
* **Normal graphs** show dense, consistent clusters of traffic.
* **Attack graphs** appear scattered, representing erratic, anomalous behaviors.
* The model generalizes well to unseen traffic patterns due to inductive learning.

## 🔬 How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**

   * Loads UNSW-NB15 dataset
   * Normalizes features and encodes categorical fields
   * Maps “Normal” → 0 and “Attack” → 1

2. **Graph Construction**

   * Treats each flow as a node
   * Builds edges via KNN (k=5) to capture similarities
   * Creates `.pt` graph objects compatible with PyTorch Geometric

3. **Model Training (GraphSAGE)**

   * Learns node embeddings via neighborhood aggregation
   * Aggregates local and global graph structure
   * Trains using cross-entropy loss

4. **Prediction & Visualization**

   * Loads trained model for new graphs
   * Predicts binary outcome (Normal/Attack)
   * Displays visual graph topology using NetworkX

## 🧠 Experimental Insights

* The GraphSAGE model achieved strong convergence with minimal overfitting.
* Visualization confirmed structural irregularities in attack graphs.
* The Streamlit interface allows real-time interaction and visualization of classification results.
* This validates that **graph-based relational learning** is effective for modern intrusion detection.
